Hi! I'm Quinne Yan Lin 林妍, currently pursuing a Ph.D. in [Computer Science](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/computing/), which I began in March 2025. My Ph.D. is fully funded by a five-year **Postgraduate Research Studentship**, which covers full international tuition fees and tax-free living [UKRI stipend](https://www.ukri.org/news/ukri-is-increasing-phd-stipends-and-improving-student-support/),and an integrated PGTA position(formal university staff) that is co-terminous with my doctoral studies.

My research interests center on **Large Language Models**,  memory-efficient training, inference acceleration, and sparse attention mechanisms, **Agents& RAG**, as well as diffusion-based generative methods that extend across text, vision, and multimodal domains, to develop more robust, trustworthy, and resource-efficient AI systems.

I completed both my bachelor degree in **Finance and Economics** across Mainland China and Taiwan. After graduation, I worked for three years in the financial industry, gaining practical experience at Essence Securities and China Construction Bank. I then made a career transition into computing, earning a **Master's degree in Data Science at Durham University**, a programme combining equal parts mathematics and programming, which has led me to pursue a PhD.
