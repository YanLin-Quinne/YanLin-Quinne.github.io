Hi! I’m Kate Wenqi Zhu, currently pursuing a Ph.D. in [Applied Mathematics](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/groups/numerical-analysis) at the [University of Oxford](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/), advised by Prof. [Coralia Cartis](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/people/coralia.cartis) and fully funded by the [CIMDA-Oxford Studentship](https://cimda-oxford.datasig.ac.uk/team).

My research interests center on **utilizing higher-order information for efficient nonconvex optimization**, encompassing computational complexity analysis, **tensor approximation**, sum of squares techniques, implementable high-order subproblem solvers, and adaptive regularization methods.

I completed both my undergraduate and first master’s degrees in **Mathematics at Oxford**, as well as an M.Sc. in Mathematical Modelling and Scientific Computing, supervised by Yuji Nakatsukasa. After my undergraduate studies, I took a career break to gain practical industry experience at Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan before beginning my Ph.D.

**Potential Collaborations:** If you are interested in these topics, feel free to reach out for more information!
