Hi! I'm Quinne Yan Lin, currently pursuing a Ph.D. in [Computer Science](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/computing/), starting in Mar 2025, the first-year PhD student now. My research is fully funded by Postgraduate Research Studentship, which is 5-year package, covering full international tuition fees and tax-free living [UKRI stipend](https://www.ukri.org/news/ukri-is-increasing-phd-stipends-and-improving-student-support/),equivalent in scope to a U.S. Teaching Assistantship. I am working as PGTA (regular fixed-term staff, contract is 5-year and co-terminous with the PhD) within the School of Computing.

My research interests center on **Large Language Modesl**, memory-efficient tranining, sparse attention, **Agents& RAG**, sum of diffusion techniques.

I completed both my bachelor degree in **Finance and Economics at Mainland China and Taiwan**.  After graduation,I worked for three years in the financial industry, gaining practical experience at **Essence Securities** and **China Construction Bank**. Following this, I made a career transition into computing, earning a **Master degree in Data Science at Durham**, a programme combining equal parts mathematics and programming, which has led me to pursue a PhD.
