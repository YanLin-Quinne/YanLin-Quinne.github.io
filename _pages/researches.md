## Potential Collaborations  
If you are interested in these topics, please feel free to get in touch. I am always open to potential collaborations across disciplines and application domains.  

## Research Interests  
- Reducing hallucination and improving factual grounding in large language models (LLMs)  
- Building LLM agents that can reason, plan, and act in open-ended environments  
- Prompting, fine-tuning, and evaluation of LLMs for real-world applications  
- Integrating LLMs into interactive systems and tools (e.g. retrieval-augmented generation, tool use, multi-agent collaboration)  
- Exploring responsible and explainable AI, particularly in multilingual and cross-cultural contexts  

I consider myself an **LLM engineer and applied researcher**, with a strong interest in aligning generative AI systems with human needs and real-world challenges.
