My teaching is deeply informed by my research expertise in large language models and multimodal artificial intelligence. In both undergraduate and postgraduate teaching, I emphasise clarity, accessibility, and inclusivity, ensuring that students gain confidence in approaching advanced computational methods while developing transferable problem-solving skills.  

I am also pursuing the **Associate Fellowship Pathway (AFHEA)** through Newcastle University’s academic development scheme.
