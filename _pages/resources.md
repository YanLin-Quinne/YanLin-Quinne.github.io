##  Useful Resources

##  Inspirations

People and words that remind me why I pursue research:  

- *“God is a girl.”* — from Dr [Kefan Xue](https://kefanxue.com/). 

In her I have witnessed the strength of gentleness. 

- *"As a woman in a very male-dominated subject, there is no question that challenges remain to achieve gender parity. But this is all the more reason why we women need to keep pursuing our passions in mathematics and nudging those scales towards balance."* - from Dr [Sarah Heaps](https://www.durham.ac.uk/staff/sarah-e-heaps/). 

I remain deeply grateful for her teaching at Durham, which first introduced me to the foundations of Bayesian statistics. 

- I am also thankful to Pro [Camila Caiado](https://www.durham.ac.uk/staff/c-c-d-s-caiado/) and Dr [Yi Wang](https://wangy.org/), whose thoughtful guidance gave me clarity and encouragement at a time when I was struggling to choose between PhD offers.
