**Newcastle University, School of Computing – Postgraduate Research Studentship with PGTA Contract (2024–2029)**
Offered an integrated five-year package combining a PhD studentship and employment as a Postgraduate Teaching Assistant (PGTA), equivalent in scope to a U.S. TA scholarship. The award covers full international tuition fees (valued at approximately £155,000 over five years for a Computer Science PhD) and provides a UKRI-standard tax-free living stipend (£19,237 per annum for 2024/25, subject to annual increase).
I am the final cohort recipient, as the scheme has since been discontinued.
**Total value: ~£251,185.**
